# Reorganize String

Given a string s, rearrange the characters of s so that any two adjacent characters are not the same.

Return any possible rearrangement of s or return "" if not possible.

## Example 1:

```bash
Input: s = "aab"
Output: "aba"
```

## Example 2:

```bash
Input: s = "aaab"
Output: ""
```

## Constraints:

`1 <= s.length <= 500`
s consists of lowercase English letters.
